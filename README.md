The Portfolio 1 assignment is a single-page portfolio website showcasing three of my projects from the Frontend Development programme:

# Description:

 This repository contains the Portfolio 1 assignment for the Frontend Development course. I have turned it into a full-page vertical carousel implemented using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
